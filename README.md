# Python_Practice_Files
Practice files from Python trainings where I did more, different, interesting things than base.  
Count_substring is a function to take in a string & substring, make them lowercase, then count the occurences of the substring in the string.  
Basic_exception_handling adds additional excepts to the safe_division practice code and also adds handling to the input boxes to make sure only integers are passed in.  
TextAnalyzer - I didn't do anything special (yet) to this one, but it looks useful and I have noted additions I can make to it as I gain more experience.
